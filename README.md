# Data_science3 Portfolio assignment 

## Introduction
This machine learning project aims to explore various techniques and algorithms for manifold learning, anomaly detection, 
and model creation. The project focuses on implementing and analyzing Support Vector Classifier, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, 
and comparing Bagging vs Boosting methods. The main objective is to gain insights into these algorithms and their performance in different scenarios,
providing a foundation for understanding their strengths and limitations in machine learning tasks.
Through this project, we aim to enhance our understanding of these techniques and their practical applications in real-world problems.
